## Emacs
### Resources

### Learning Objectives
* What is Emacs
	- Emacs is an extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor
* Who is Richard Stallman
	- Richard Matthew Stallman, also known by his initials, rms, is an American free software movement activist and programmer. He campaigns for software to be distributed in such a manner that its users have the freedom to use, study, distribute, and modify that software.

	- Use Ctrl-x f to open a file from within Emacs. Ctrl-x Ctrl-s to save the file.

	- For conveniently switching between a few buffers, use the commands C-x LEFT and C-x RIGHT
* How to use the mark and the point to set the region
	- To set the mark, type C- SPC ( set-mark-command ). This makes the mark active
* How to cut and paste lines and regions
	- To cut the text, press C-w.
	- To copy the text, press M-w.
	- To paste the text, press C-y.
* How to search forward and backward
	- C-s for forward search, and C-r for reverse search.
* How to invoke commands by name
	- Type M-x , then the name of the command, and finally hit RETURN (notice that all this happens in the echo area)
* How to undo
	- C-x u or C-_
* How to cancel half-entered commands
	- quitting with C-g , and aborting with C-] or M-x top-level
* How to quit Emacs
	- C-z and Emacs will be suspended. To get back into Emacs, type %emacs at the shell prompt. To quit Emacs permanently, type C-x C-c.

### Learning Objectives
* What is source code management
	- It allows a developer to organize code iterations chronologically, and version it for an application.
* What is Git
	- Git is a source code management tool, that comes with a command-line tool for its users.
* What is GitHub
	- GitHub is one of many services that provide at the same time:
		- a Git repository server to push your code to
		- a web UI to that view your repositories, with their files and commits
* What is the difference between Git and GitHub
	- Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. 
	- GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
* How to create a repository
	- The easiest way is through GiHub web UI.
* What is a README
	- It is a text file that contains information for the user about the software, project, code, or game, or it might contain instructions, help, or details about the patches or updates.
* How to write good READMEs
	- Take a look at [How to write a good README file] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/)
* How to commit
	- git commit -m "Message: What's this commit about?"
	- For more info take a look at: [10 git commands every dev should know] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/10-important-git-commands-that-every-developer-should-know/)
* How to write helpful commit messages
	- Take a look at [How to write a Git commit message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
* How to push code
	- git push <remote> <branch-name>
However, if your branch is newly created, then you also need to upload the branch with any of the following commands (just one of them):
	- git push --set-upstream <remote> <name-of-your-branch>
	- git push -u origin <branch_name>
* How to pull updates
	- git pull <remote>
* How to create a branch
	- git branch <branch-name>
* How to merge branches
	- For example, when you want to merge your feature branch into the **dev** branch:
		- First you should switch to the dev branch:
			- git checkout dev
		- Before merging, you should update your local dev branch:
			- git fetch
		- Finally, you can merge your feature branch into dev:
			- git merge <branch-name>
* How to work as collaborators on a project
	- Take a look at [Effective pull requests and other good practices for teams using GitHub](https://codeinthehole.com/tips/pull-requests-and-other-good-practices-for-teams-using-github/)
* Which files should and which files should not appear in your repo
	- Take a look at [What not to save into a Git repository] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-not-to-save-into-a-git-repository-29779ee94b96/)
### Additional info
#### Install git
If git is not already installed on your terminal:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install git
```
#### Basic usage
```
$ git clone <repo>
$ touch test
$ git add test
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git push origin main
```
#### Clone a repository using a personal Token
```
root@896cf839cf9a:/# git clone https://{YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN}@github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/{YOUR_REPO}.git                  
Cloning into '{YOUR_REPO}'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository
```
### Quiz answers
* Question #0
	- You have the following files in your project directory:

```
julien@ubuntu:/tmp/git_project$ ls
0-test  0-test~ #0-test# file1  file2
```
You’ve edited 0-test and you want to add it to your GitHub repo. 
- What is the correct command to add only 0-test?
	- git add 0-test
* Question #1
	- What command can you use to see what changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked by Git?
		- git status
